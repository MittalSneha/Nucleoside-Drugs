**Feature Extraction from Transmission Data**

This repository provides a methodology for extracting features from transmission data using a Python script. Follow these steps to prepare your data and generate the corresponding features.

**Steps to Extract Features**

**1. Prepare the Data File**

**Create an Excel File:**

Name the Excel file Data.xlsx (or any preferred name).
Ensure that the file contains two columns:

**Energy:** Energy range values
**Transmission:** Corresponding transmission values

Refer to the demo data file provided in the repository for format and structure.

**2. Run the Python Script**

For the code, Google Colab notebook is provided

**3. Output:**

The script will generate a file named 'features.xlsx' in the same directory. This file will contain the extracted features (F1 to F13).

**Notes**

Ensure the column names in the 'Data.xlsx' file match those used in the script.
Adjust the file paths as necessary if your files are located in different directories.

**Additional Resources**

For demo data format and examples, refer to the demo data file included in this repository.
